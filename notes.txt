Protocol Conformance Checker
============================

Grammar is limited to only check 'equals', 'subtype' and 'share' (and substitution).
Instead of recursion, we have 'typedef' for clarity.

NOTE: We currently do not enforce all well-formedness conditions on types. If a type is not well-formed the algorithm may not terminate.


FIXMES:
=======

* missing failure tests on conformance on 'test2.txt'

* FIX on keyF that creates key to table cycles in the types, needs to consider environment due to bounded quantification.


- define error constants/enum instead of having constants spread out through the code.

- use 'const' keyword for constants. Note that some browsers may not support this. However, our target is Google Chrome which does support 'const'. See: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/
