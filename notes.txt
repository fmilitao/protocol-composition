Protocol Conformance Checker
============================

Grammar is limited to only check 'subtype' and 'share', as well as 'typedef' for convenience.

* grammar simplifications to remove some unnecessary parenthesis on 'share' constructs, etc.

De Bruijn indexes for equals:
-> updateIndexes after substitution
-> define error constants/enum instead of having constants spread out through the code.

Shallow equals / and full equals that uses lookup table to avoid loops.

TODO:
=====

- use 'const' keyword for constants. Note that some browsers may not support this. However, our target is Google Chrome which does support 'const'. See: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/

GRAMMAR FIXES:
 not A <: A // subtype test
 not A == A // equality test
 --> ambiguity in the grammar??
