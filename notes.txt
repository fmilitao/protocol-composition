Protocol Conformance Checker
============================

Grammar is limited to only check 'equals', 'subtype' and 'share' (and substitution).
Instead of recursion, we have 'typedef' for clarity.


TODO:
=====

* MISSING SUBTYPING RULES:


  X <: A in Gamma
-------------------
 Gamma |- X <: A
 FIXME: subtyping needs typing environment because of this, but equals does not because variable equality is enough.
 FIXME: detecting cycles on subtyping is also more complex due to different bounds on the environment.
 	How to represent this?


* New Protocol Conformance

- define error constants/enum instead of having constants spread out through the code.

STYLE:
======

- use 'const' keyword for constants. Note that some browsers may not support this. However, our target is Google Chrome which does support 'const'. See: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/


FIXME --- GRAMMAR:
==================
* grammar simplifications to remove some unnecessary parenthesis on 'share' constructs, etc.
* TODO: read jison documentation on token precedences.

 not A <: A // subtype test
 not A == A // equality test
 	--> PROBLEM: ambiguity in the grammar!
 share A as B, C, D, E;
 share D as D, D;
