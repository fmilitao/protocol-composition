/* WELCOME!

 Deaf-Parrot is a prototype implementation of our language written entirely
 in javascript and should run directly in a modern web-browser (Google Chrome
 preferred).

 Parsing and typechecking errors should be flagged on-the-fly.

 NOTES:
  - allows C-style comments.
  - the languages uses a few (very simple) IDIOMS for convenience,
  (see 'idioms' example file, on OLD EXAMPLES tab).
  - recursive types are only possible through recursive type definitions (this
  makes them easier to read and use). All typedefs can be mutually recursive.
  - sharing support is still EXPERIMENTAL (i.e. work in progress).
